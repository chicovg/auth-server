#+TITLE: Todos

* Spec
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749

* DONE login page
ideally, I could use this for admins and users, lets see
** DONE cancel button links to home
** DONE tighten up users schema
** DONE create admin user via repl
** DONE POST credentials and redirect
* STARTED example client app
** DONE landing page
** TODO protected page
- should request user data
- get /api/user
  name, email, address, phone
*** TODO user details in table
*** TODO user api
* STARTED Oauth flows
** DONE authorization code flow
actors:
- resource owner (user)
- user agent (browser)
- auth-client (web app)
- auth-server (service)
*** DONE example client
- generate cljs-only client with cucumber tests
  this seems very complex - can I do this without cljs?
  - I just need a ui server with maybe 2 routes:
    - home
    - protected
- move files into same repo
*** DONE clients table
*** DONE authorization endpoint
- accepts get with following query params:
  + response_type = 'code'
  + client_id
  + redirect_uri
  + scope
  + state - ?
- validates params
- redirects to a login page with confirmation
- user inputs credentials
- redirects back to original uri
**** DONE validate params
**** DONE validate client_id
**** DONE build auth code
*** DONE token endpoint
*** DONE login button
*** DONE login page
**** DONE user confirm access to app
** TODO implicit grant flow
actors:
- resource owner (user)
- user agent (browser)
- auth-client (web app)
- auth-server (service)
** TODO resource owner credentials flow
** DONE client credentials flow
* TODO client registration UI
admin -> registers client
since I'm building my own client app, can't I just auto-register it?
then I don't need to build the registation page right away
** TODO get registration form
** TODO registration endpoint
* TODO Add users UI
admin users can add other users
